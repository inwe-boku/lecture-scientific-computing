    "# Exercise 5 - Implement the function round (optional bonus exercise)\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a function `my_own_round(number, ndigits)` without using the function `round()`. You can use the function `int()` to discard the values after the comma, i.e. `int(2.73902) == int(2)`. Call your own round function with three different values of your choice, then run the cell with test statements below to further test your function. Before you start writing your function, you may want to test `int()` on arbitrary values, e.g. `int(2.432)`, `int(1.004)` to further understand how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function does not need to work for negative values. Bonus points if you make it work for negative values too :)\n",
    "\n",
    "In some rare cases `my_own_round()` may return a different result than `round()`: you don't need to handle the cases where the `number` is exactly in the middle between of the two choices, e.g. for `round(1.5, 0)` both results `1.0` or `2.0` are a valid solution. Similarly for `round(1.45, 1)` both `1.4` and `1.5` are a valid solution. Life is too complicated in this case ([due to numerical errors and round half to even](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round)).\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note:_ `round()` behaves differently in Python 3 than in Python 2. In Python 3, `round` sometimes rounds up and sometimes rounds down when the `number` is exactly in the middle between two choices. [This notebook](https://datalore.jetbrains.com/view/notebook/eutbkU7PMymp5F9diCVfK1) explains a bit more details (it's the answer to a question which popped up during the lecture in 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 1:** If you want to round `1.123` to `1.1`, you can use the function `int()` on the value `11.23` to discard the digits `2` and `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 2:** You probably will need some kind of distinction between the cases where you need to round up or down. An if statement is a good choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 3:** There is a solution with 4-5 lines of code which uses only int(), **, +, - *, =, <= and if. You should not need to use more than one `if` statement. If you want to make it work for negative numbers too, `abs()` may come in handy."
